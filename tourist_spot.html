The lake sits over a thousand feet above sea level, isolated from the noise of the plains and bordered by untouched hill forests..</p>

                <p>Kaptai Lake, the largest man-made lake in Bangladesh, was formed in the 1960s by damming the Karnaphuli River. Its deep blue water winds through hills and forests, creating long, narrow channels that look like rivers resting between green ridges. Small islands rise from the surface like quiet pieces of land adrift, and the lake's shoreline curves gently around valleys, villages, and old hill paths that now meet the water's edge.</p>

Built by the Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, the bridge has become a symbol of Rangamati — a narrow path suspended between water and forest, where the stillness of the lake meets the soft rise of the hills. </p>
